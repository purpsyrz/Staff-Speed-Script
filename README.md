# Staff-Speed-Script
Staff Speed Script made for esx servers only. Read the README.MD for more info.
 
1.The script uses the command /togglespeed to toggle the speed boost on and off.

2.Modify STAFF_GROUPS to include the actual groups that should have access to the speed boost.

3.Adjust SPEED_MULTIPLIER to control how much faster staff members can run.

side note, if you need further customization or additional features, feel free to ask fill_ma_hooters. <-- discord! or just do it your self becuase these are just fun projects that I do in my free time. Once you download the scripts its your script as well!
